## How it works

1. [**Create**](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) a token in your GitHub account settings with the `gist scope`
   only and **copy** it
2. [**Create**](https://gist.github.com) a new **public** Gist and copy ID from url (string after last slash)
3. **Fork** this repo
4. Go to **Settings** > **Secrets** > **Actions secrets** in **your fork**
5. **Create** new **Environment secrets:**
    - `GH_TOKEN`: GitHub token generated earlier
    - `GIST_ID`: your Gist ID
    - `URL`: your url

It's all. Go to **Actions** > **Update Gist** and **Run workflow**. Gist should update and show Lighthouse metrics.
Next, statistics will be updated automatically every day. Pin this gist on your profile!

## FAQ

#### Why does the repository have node_modules?

1. [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action#commit-tag-and-push-your-action-to-github): _...commit your action.yml, index.js, **node_modules**, package.json, package-lock.json, and README.md
   files. If you added a .gitignore file that lists node_modules, you'll need to remove that line to commit the node_modules
   directory._ 
2. `vercel/ncc` didn't work with `GoogleChrome/lighthouse`
3. I will try to get rid of it in future releases
